Hi User,

We have nagged you with a modern day business jargon “complete picture of you” a lot. So here’s one upgrade that will enable you to create a much better picture of you via your Rime profile’s

About page.

We are bringing your details from Linkedin to create a better picture of you, and creating a map of the places you have been to(courtesy: the tags you have made in your various posts).

The page is also going to have all social links associated with your profile at the bottom as well.
