Hello User,

We are not going to be yet another social media that asks you to create new password to login to Rime because we believe remembering passwords is a thing of past. Instead, just use your
authenticated social media login, and enjoy scrolling through your Rime feed.

Or if you are unwilling to use your social media login for Rime, you can instead provide your email id for login. We will send you a secured login link on your mail, and you can login by clicking on it.

Facing any troubles? Let us knowâ€¦
