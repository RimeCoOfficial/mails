 <b><?php echo app_name(); ?>â€™s New Privacy Statement</b>
</p>

<p>
  Your privacy is really important to us. We're committed to being transparent about how we treat your data, so we've re-written our privacy policy using a simpler format and clearer language. Our new <?php echo e_anchor('about/privacy', 'Privacy Statement'); ?> will take effect on July 15, 2015, so we encourage you to find time to review it. Using the <?php echo app_name(); ?> app on or after that date will tell us you have read and agreed to the terms of the Privacy Statement. You can learn more about the updated Statement in our <?php echo e_anchor('http://blog.rime.co/', 'blog post'); ?>.
