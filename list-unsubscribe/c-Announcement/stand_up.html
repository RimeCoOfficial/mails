  Indian start-ups approximately raised whooping $1.7 Billon from investors in first quarter of 2015. More than 50% of the start-ups are from e-commerce, payments and, consumer web. While there is a need and market for all those initiatives in India, but most of them are not technologically disruptive.
</p>
<p>
  Now is the time to also explore real technology innovation, and built a product/platform, which will define the start-up waves in India. Working on such initiative is Rime, it is a real technology initiative which collects and organised scattered content over the internet for better search, a unique idea in its own. We are connecting all the contents availble in the internet with their original author(User) and providers. We are the alumnus of IIT-Bombay and we believe that Rime will be "Google for people and content search", and opens up a complete new paradigm of social media interactions. Please join to explore the awesomeness, and be an early adopters.

  We would love here from you back and to connect with you for any queries.
