 <b>{_app_name}'s New Privacy Statement</b>
</p>

<p>
  Your privacy is really important to us. We're committed to being transparent about how we treat your data, so we've re-written our privacy policy using a simpler format and clearer language. Our new <a href="{_app_base_url}/about/privacy">Privacy Statement</a> will take effect on July 15, 2015, so we encourage you to find time to review it. Using the {_app_name} app on or after that date will tell us you have read and agreed to the terms of the Privacy Statement. You can learn more about the updated Statement in our <a href="http://blog.rime.co/">blog post</a>.
